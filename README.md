# The Timeline - Before ChatGPT, After ChatGPT 

This repository organizes a timeline of key events (products, services, papers, GitHub, blog posts and news) that occurred before and after the ChatGPT announcement.

Maybe it's a scene from the hottest history, so I thought it would be important to keep those memories well, so I organized them.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hollobit/BCAC_timeline/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.
