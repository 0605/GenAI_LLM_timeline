# The Timeline - Before ChatGPT, After ChatGPT 

This repository organizes a timeline of key events (products, services, papers, GitHub, blog posts) that occurred before and after the ChatGPT announcement.

Maybe it's a scene from the hottest history, so I thought it would be important to keep those memories well, so I organized them.

If you have any additions or corrections, please feel free to comment.
